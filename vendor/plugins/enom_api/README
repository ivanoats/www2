EnomApi
=======

A rails plugin that connects to the Enom Domain Registrar's API for checking
domain name availability, domain contact information, nameserver settings, etc.

Frankly, it needs a substantial amount of work at this point, but it's a start.

Example
=======

domain.rb (Active Record model for managing all domain names)
----
class Domain < ActiveRecord::Base
  manage_with_enom
  
  validate :domain_exists_in_enom_account?, :on => :create
  validates_uniqueness_of :name
end

You'll need a config file in 'config/enom_config.yml that looks something like the following:
development:
  url: http://resellertest.enom.com/interface.asp?
  username: yourusername
  password: yourpassword

test:
    url: http://resellertest.enom.com/interface.asp?
    username: yourusername
    password: yourpassword
    
production:
    url: http://reseller.enom.com/interface.asp?
    username: yourusername
    password: yourpassword
