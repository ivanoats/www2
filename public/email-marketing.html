	<h1>Who Do You Recommend for Email Marketing?</h1>
	<p>When you want to send any kind of email communication to a large group of people, you should use a professional email newsletter service, because it will ensure your message is delivered. You also do not want your web server or your regular business email server blacklisted for spam, which is another reason it's smart to separate your mass email from your normal email. You may think that you have a small list of people you email that love you and could never possibly mark your emails as spam, but it does happen. People forget that they have signed up for your list, or have a trigger happy mouse finger over the spam button.
