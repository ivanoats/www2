-> Complete testing in production environment

MIGRATION

-> Test test test!

THOUGHTS

->  Package names on all servers need to be the same as values stored within product, as those are used when provisioning on the server.  


#here's how I installed mcrypt, this shouldn't be needed after the migration.

gem install kingpong-ruby-mcrypt --source http://gems.github.com --test \
     -- --with-mcrypt-dir=/opt/local
     
LATER

-> Make dashboard suck less and more useful
-> condense number of colors used (too many green styles for example)
-> Activity log of purchases, state changes, email errors
-> Ability to cancel new hostings, domains, addons from admin.  
-> When canceling a hosting, what happens to the attached domain?
-> Login to cpanel link from admin, update password functionality.  
-> Edit hosting username before approval since some names can fail for funky reasons.
-> remove icon for cart
-> Complete user profile page
-> zFields not selected when field is selected
