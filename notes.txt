-> review cancellation policies

-> Verify cron scripts are running

-> Complete user profile page

-> Complete staging test
-> Complete production test

MIGRATION

-> IF the migration fails at any point the transactions will keep the database intact, but we should ensure emails are only sent at the correct point and we can resume somehow.  

-> Test test test!

THOUGHTS

->  Package names on all servers need to be the same as values stored within product, as those are used when provisioning on the server.  


#here's how I installed mcrypt, this shouldn't be needed after the migration.

gem install kingpong-ruby-mcrypt --source http://gems.github.com --test \
     -- --with-mcrypt-dir=/opt/local
     
LATER

-> Make dashboard suck less and more useful

-> condense number of colors used (too many green styles for example)

-> Activity log of purchases, state changes, email errors
