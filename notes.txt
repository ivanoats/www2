SITE

-> Listing of users / adding / removing in account is not done.  

-> Deleting / Changing Status / Editing unmanaged hosting not yet possible

-> Test emails on staging server

-> review cancellation policies

-> Make dashboard suck less and more useful

-> condense number of colors used (too many green styles for example)

-> IE testing

-> Verify cron scripts are running

-> Activity log of purchases, state changes, email errors

MIGRATION

-> Test credit card saving

-> Test test test!

-> What to do if there is no credit card for a user (paypal user?)


THOUGHTS

->  Package names on all servers need to be the same as values stored within product, as those are used when provisioning on the server.  

->  We may want to migrate to automatically provisioning as customer has already paid at that point but has not yet seen any product.  But I think we talked about this already - something about abuse.
